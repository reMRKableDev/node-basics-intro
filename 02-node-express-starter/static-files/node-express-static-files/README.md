## Getting Started 🏁

These instructions will help you get started with this project.

### Installing

Run:

```
npm install
```

This should retrieve all the necessary dependencies named in the `package.json` file.

### How To Use:

1. Once dependencies are installed, make sure to modify the ```.env.sample``` with the correct port values:

```
PORT = YOUR-DESIRED-PORT-NUMBER-GOES-HERE
```

2. Rename the ```.env.sample``` to simply ```env``` so that the environment variables can be read correctly.

3. Once the above is done, the project can be run using:

```
npm start
```

OR

```
npm run dev
```

## Running the tests 🧪

This app utilizes Jest & Enzyme for testing the components. Tests can be run by using the command:

```
npm test

OR

npm run test
```
